                <li>Each trip is for two people.</li>
                <li>Once a dealer has been registered for a trip, the ability to change to a different destination whether higher or lower in level —is at the discretion of Hunter Douglas, based on availability, space commitments and/or re-booking penalties. Dealers will be confirmed for trips based on available space and a “first-qualified, first-confirmed” basis.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Trip Qualification</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The 2025 Windows To The World program qualification period is January 1, 2025 through November 30, 2025.</li>
                <li>Individual qualification targets for a dealer’s registered trip will be provided on The Link.</li>

            <h2>Taxation - US Dealers</h2>
            <ul>

                <li>IRS Form 1099-MISC will be issued to all dealers that earn a trip. The forms will be issued for the fair market value of the trip as determined by Hunter Douglas’ reasonable discretion.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Taxation - Canadian Dealers</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>All awards earned are considered by Revenue Canada to be taxable income.</li>
                <li>T4A's will not be issued and it shall be the recipients' responsibility to report the fair market value of their trip award (as determined by Hunter Douglas' reasonable discretion) as income when filing tax returns.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>General Provisions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Travelers must be 21 years of age or older or accompanied by a qualifying dealer 21 years of age or older</li>

                <li>Flights must be coordinated through Madison, our travel headquarters, even if dealers wish to use their own travel points. Dealers will not be reimbursed for flights they have self-purchased.</li>
                <li>No other awards or cash will be provided in lieu of the trips published and there is no cash value for unused portions of the program.</li>

                <li>Hunter Douglas reserves the right to audit compliance with the qualification requirements and reserves the right to amend, alter or cancel this program at any time.</li>
                <li>In the event of any ambiguity of any of the foregoing, the decision and interpretation thereof by Hunter Douglas will be final.</li>
